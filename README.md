# Code-Quiz

## Description
First I started by created the layout for the code quiz in the index file. Adding the header,sections, buttons, and form for the user to save their score. Then I started Javascript defining a list of global variables and created an array to hold all of my quiz questions choices and answers. Next I created functions to start the code quiz that would display a question once the start button is clicked. Once all questions are answered the users score will show up and be able to save score by adding initials.
