# Code-Quiz

## Description
First I started by created the layout for the code quiz in the index file. Adding the header,sections, buttons, and form for the user to save their score. Then I started Javascript defining a list of global variables and created an array to hold all of my quiz questions choices and answers. Next I created functions to start the code quiz that would display a question once the start button is clicked. Once all questions are answered the users score will show up and be able to save score by adding initials. Users are able to come back to the website to check out the highschores.
